# Project Omnis

## A community driven open-source shooter game

As an avid gamer myself, whenever a new game gets developed, you never know what you will get. From pay-to-win, to countless unbalanced characters/weapons and ultimately, a usually disappointed and angry fanbase.

Omnis' goal is to be the first community game. **You** play it, so if you don't like something or want to add something, you can!

To contribute, please read the [contributing](docs/contributing.md) file for more information

In the [progress](docs/progress.md) file, I will outline what the timeline of the project is, including what is in the backlog, in progress, and finished!

Meanwhile, once this project takes shape I will make a Discord for the community.
